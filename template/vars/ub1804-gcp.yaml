  # The latest version of docker-worker does not work with Ubuntu 18.04. The bundled nodejs version with the latest docker-worker versions is too new:
  # The fs-ext package that comes with the node version bundled required a GLIBC version higher than what ships with Ubuntu 18.04 and there is no proper way around this.

  # With Ubuntu 18.04 on GCP (for Firefox CI), for some reason (tracking in Bug 1809906 / RELOPS-356) when installing the loopback package we fail to load this later down the line when creating workers.
  # However, building the loopback module from source does make it function correctly as it always used to.
